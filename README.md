Do you know how the rainbow looks like? Have you ever had a chance to see it? Did you like it? D
o you think it’s a miracle or just the science? As a matter of fact, this appearance is nothing but a
habitual Nature’s trick. We see a rainbow when both it’s raining and it’s shining. Water from rain makes white sunl
ight become many-colored. It always shows up mainly opposite the Sun. That’s the way a rainbow appears.
As a rule a rainbow is circular and very colorful. Have you ever counted the colors of a rainbow?
How many are there? Only three, seven or ten? Can you guess?
If you said SEVEN – well done! Can you tell them? What’s the first one? The most vi
sible when you look at a rainbow. Of course 
it’s red. What’s the next one? Sure, it’s orange! Have you noticed the tendency? One color is very similar to following color.
The third color is yellow! We see it clearly watching a rainbow, doesn’t we? Color number 4 is green and number 6 is blue. 
Can you guess what the next one is? The next two colors remind you of blue - indigo and undoubtedly violet. All colors gradate into one another.
